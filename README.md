# Open AI Gym
#### # OpenAI Gym with PPO and DQN

My learning journey with OpenAI Gym environments, where I explored how to use reinforcement learning to train models. I implemented **PPO** and **DQN** algorithms to solve classic control tasks like **CartPole** and **MountainCar**.

### Environments Explored
1. **CartPole**:
   - Objective: Balance a pole on a moving cart for as long as possible.
   - Algorithm Used: **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
   - Result: Successfully trained a model to balance the pole for extended periods.

2. **MountainCar**:
   - Objective: Drive an underpowered car to the top of a hill by building momentum.
   - Algorithm Used: **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**
   - Result: Trained a model to consistently reach the flag by leveraging momentum effectively.
